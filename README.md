# Affordable Budget App

## Design <br>
Money. This is something that everyone wants, but not at all of people know how to manage it. Even when they try, they find it difficult because they cannot keep track of their receipts or simply, they forget to get home and fill out their budget expenses. With Affordable Budget App, we can change your wallet! This app is a way that people can create a budget, keep track of their expenses, and make a group that can manage it, so everyone is on the same page. They will even be able to track their own overall contribution to the expenditure of the group money, to see if they need to adjust their habits.
