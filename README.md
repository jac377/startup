# startup

Once I worked through the description of this chapter or section of the class, I was feeling confident with the Git Bash environment. However, I liked the idea that I can also use Visual Studio to do the same. This is something I was wondering on how I could use VS and achieve the same result than Git Bash. Furthemore, I now understand how the commit and push/pull work. This is a great advantage to know how I can work in different places.
