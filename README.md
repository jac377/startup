# Affordable Budget App

## Design <br>
**Elevator Pitch**<br>
How many times have you tried to keep up with your hydration? Well, I lost my count. Today, drinking water is becoming more and more important. However, it is hard to keep track of how much water we drink. That is why we created Water Tracker. This app lets you track you water consumption every day. But should you do it alone? No! You will be able to do it with other people as well, and they will be able to send message to remind you to drink that cup of water you are missing. So, are you ready to help others keep themselves hydrated?
