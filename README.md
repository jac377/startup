Once I worked through the description of this chapter or section of the class, I was feeling confident with the Git Bash environment. However, I liked the idea that I can also use Visual Studio to do the same. This is something I was wondering on how I could use VS and achieve the same result than Git Bash. Furthemore, I now understand how the commit and push/pull work. This is a great advantage to know how I can work in different places.

# Purpose

The purpose of this reposityory will be for me to create and practice documenting my learning through the course of CS 260. <br> 
I willl annotate commands, or important information that I will like to have handy, so I don't have to be search for it. I will divide it per console/environment, so it is easier to find what I am looking for.
